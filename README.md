# NEURALAGA

It's a small proof of concept to learn basic Unity machine learning agents. 

Two different Neural Networks(mainly [PPO](https://blog.openai.com/openai-baselines-ppo/) and [NEAT](http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf) ) were taught how to play a basic game similar to Galaga and the performance results were compared with each other.
